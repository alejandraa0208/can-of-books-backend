# Can of Books

## Author: Alejandra Altamirano & Sydney Pagalan

## Version: 1.0.0

Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

Estimates
<!-- See below -->

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack, phone and discord

How often will you take breaks?

- Every hour for 10-15 minutes.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Ask instructor or TA for help to get back on track.

## Cooperative

Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

Alejandra - Communication, Leadership, Adaptability, Problem Solving

Sydney - Flexibility and Creativity

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Alejandra - My strengths can help make sure we both are effectively contributing to the projects and making sure to accomplish daily goals and requirements.

Sydney - Embrace changes in requirements and feedback, iteratively refining the app's features. Tackle challenges creatively, considering multiple solutions that suit the app's goals.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Alejandra - I want to grow greater strength in understanding the systems and servers.

Sydney - Work together to understand complex code snippets. Discuss concepts, share resources, and teach each other to reinforce understanding.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

We plan to split work between front and backend. And occassionally switch repos so we both can get a better understanding for the code. Reviewing each others code and collaboratively write code in real-time.

## Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

 Reevaluate the distribution of tasks and responsibilities. Schedule regular check-in meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

Emphasize the importance of each team member's input and skills. Introduce a rotation system where both team members take turns leading different aspects of the project like the Driver-Navigator Collaboration.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Openly discussing our respective skill levels and areas of expertise. Align on the common goal and vision for the application. Approach the project as a learning journey.
